<h2>10/16</h2>

<p>It would be great to get my API key set up and access info using insomnia today. That seems like a reasonable start.</p>

<p>Found a good API I think. Had to create an account at rapidapi.com and logged in with my github account.</p>

<p>Strike the above from the record. That requires me to put in a credit card. Even though I think it could work, I don't want to do that. So I found a different API: <a href="https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction">balldontlie</a>.</p>

<p>They don't have a standings and their data about a given game doesn't contain information about the players involved, just some data about the teams like final score.</p>

<p>Not impossible for me to build a way to check players and compare their data and reference all of the stuff together, but a lot of work. I would need to reconstruct entire rosters of teams.</p>

<p>Strike the above from the record. The data doesn't connect players at all and doesn't even have individual game stats connected to players in any way. </p>

<p>Once more with feeling: <a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api">This</a> looks like it takes data directly from nba.com. </p>


<p>How the hell do I start a python project again...?</p>

<p>Their docs are a little dense, way more options than I will hopefully ever need.</p>

<p>Check the demo for some examples. Tomorrow, I would like to be able to find standing and boxscore information.</p>
